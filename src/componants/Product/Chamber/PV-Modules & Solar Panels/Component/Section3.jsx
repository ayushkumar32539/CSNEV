                The rapid change in the growth of solar industry has led to the
                high demand creation for solar products/modules in the recent
                years. Especially the PV modules that generate solar energy the
                demand has been phenomenon in the last few years. Hence the need
                for testing these products for various environmental stresses
                viz., temperature, humidity, solar radiations etc., has been
                increased substantially. In order meet this demand on a
                cost-effective solution CENVS Technologies manufactures the
                test chambers suitable to comply various international standards
                like IEC, UL and other organizations.

                The above table indicates the sample test procedures of solar
                panels/PV modules testing according the most recognized
                standards. CENVS can design and manufacture chambers according
                to the customer needs on specified standards, sizes of panels,
                ramp rate or if the customer wishes to have independent chamber
                for damp heat cycle, we can provide the same to meeting your
                demand of testing the panels.
