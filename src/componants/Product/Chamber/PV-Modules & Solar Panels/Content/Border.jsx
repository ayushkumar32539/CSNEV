            description: 'The solar industry has experienced rapid growth in recent years, leading to a surge in demand for solar products and modules, particularly PV modules that generate solar energy. As a result, the need for testing these products for various environmental stresses such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation has increased significantly.To meet this demand in a cost-effective manner, Envisys Technologies has developed test chambers that comply with various international standards, including IEC, UL, and other organizations. Our test chambers are designed to provide accurate and reliable testing for PV modules, ensuring that they meet the required standards for performance and durability.At Envisys Technologies, we understand the importance of testing solar products and modules under various environmental conditions, and we are committed to providing high-quality test chambers that deliver consistent results. Our test chambers are easy to use and maintain, making them an ideal choice for manufacturers looking to test their products efficiently and effectively.The above table indicates the sample test procedures of solar panels/PV modules testing according the most recognized standards. Envisys can design and manufacture chambers according to the customer needs on specified standards, sizes of panels, ramp rate or if the customer wishes to have independent chamber for damp heat cycle, we can provide the same to meeting your demand of testing the panels.'
