    Para1:
      "Vibration testing in a climatic chamber allows the product to be subjected to a variety of tests, including vibrations, temperature fluctuations, and climatic variations. This test  evaluates an equipment's or component's resistance to a  combination of climatic and mechanical stresses which can impair  performance in regular use. Aerospace and automotive components  are two of the most common types of items that must undergo such  tests to assure user safety and reliability.",
