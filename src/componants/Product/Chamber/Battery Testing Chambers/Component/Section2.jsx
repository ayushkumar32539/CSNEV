          <p>
            Batteries are the future of energy storage, and they need to be put
            through their paces in testing to guarantee they can work safely and
            reliably. CENVS, based in Roorkee, India, is one of the topmost
            manufacturers and suppliers of battery test chamber products that
            offer temperature and climatic chambers with a variety of safety
            packages that are aligned with risk standards, environmental
            criteria, or test types for conducting lithium-ion battery testing.
            CENVS’ battery testing chamber products are ideal for performing
            tests on lithium-ion cells and modules. Lithium-ion batteries can
            pose a range of risks when handled. System operators must assess the
            level of risk and use an appropriate safety concept to mitigate it.
            Portable electronic equipment has traditionally used rechargeable
            lithium batteries. Reliability and safety are becoming increasingly
            critical for electric vehicles. The batteries must work well in both
            hot and cold temperatures while neither leaking or exploding and
            providing a safety issue.
