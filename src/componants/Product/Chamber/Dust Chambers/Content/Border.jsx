Our blowing sand and dust test chamber is designed in accordance with international standards and client needs and assist in measuring the flexibility of products to resist sand that can penetrate cracks, crevices, bearings, and joints, while not degrading performance, effectiveness, and maintainability because of abrasion (erosion) or preventive effects of huge, sharp-edged particles. Our dust test chamber products are made using cutting-edge technology and high-quality components. We consider the needs of the client and develop the chambers with the utmost safety in mind. The dust chamber products from Envisys simulate the exposure of automotive and electrical components to high amounts of dust. Our industrial dust and sand test chamber products are used in different industries such as automotive, military and defense, optics, computer systems, optics and displays, coatings, solar energy, among others. We are known in these industries as one of the forefront dust chamber manufacturers and price effective suppliers in Bangalore, India. Additionally, our sand and dust test chamber products come with fully programmable control systems to offer the best possible test environment. These dust test chamber products are also equipped with complete measurement equipment for determining the rates of dust and sand fallout, including the air rate movement. Our dust test chambers are designed to simulate a dusty environment in a small space, in accordance with Indian and international testing requirements, for research and development projects requiring dust resistance in automotive and electrical components.These dust chamber machines simulate dust in a controlled environment according to the set specifications. Envisys can provide customised solutions in addition to the regular line, thanks to its decades of experience in creating customised dust chamber products, its technical know-how, and attention to detail and the needs of all our clients.
