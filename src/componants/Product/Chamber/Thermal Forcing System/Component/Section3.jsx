          Creative Environmental Solutions cutting-edge temperature forcing system is created and
          developed for thermal testing that requires severe temperatures and
          quick, accurate results. It is a micro cooling unit designed to
          simulate the various working temperature conditions on the electronic
          clipboard. In its standard configuration, it is a versatile air
          conditioning system that may be customized to meet specific needs.
          CENVS is a global leader and innovator in temperature forcing
          systems, solutions, and temperature systems. From their traditional
          applications in semiconductor testing, failure analysis, and device
          characterization to their broader use in PCB and electronic
          sub-assembly testing, our custom temperature forcing system have a
          system with the temperature capabilities to meet clients’ needs. These
          thermal forcing system products offer an innovative temperature
          testing solution that allows clients to perform device, board, and
          module testing right where they need it - at their test bench, in
          their production facility, or in their lab. We are always improving
          and innovating our technology to provide a more flexible design that
          meets world-class performance standards.

          From product creation in product engineering labs to final assembly
          and test on the production floor, temperature forcing system products
          are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Engineers test
          that the sensor or IC is functioning under various environmental
          circumstances, such as severe temperatures, as part of the
          qualification and characterization process. Burn-in, electrical, hot
          and cold testing at certain temperatures and other environmental test
          simulations are all part of the engineering and production stages to
          satisfy standards in industries like automotive and aerospace. This is
          due to the fact that once installed in real-world applications,
          semiconductor devices are frequently exposed to harsh environmental
          conditions. CENVS is a global pioneer and innovator in the
          development, production, and distribution of cutting-edge thermal
          forcing system solutions, which are largely utilized by semiconductor
          manufacturers to test their IC devices at high temperatures. The
          temperature forcing system uses modern and patented technology to
          provide quick, accurate, stable, and cost-effective solutions.
          Engineers check the sensor or IC is operational in various
          environmental circumstances, such as severe temperature, as part of
          the qualification and characterization process to meet the automotive,
          airspace, or other industries criteria. CENVS is revolutionizing
          temperature testing and control with its industry-standard temperature
          control units, allowing semiconductor manufacturers to increase their
          profitability and reliability by improving the efficiency and accuracy
          of their IC test processes. To appropriately define the device
          performance, traditional integrated circuit (IC) production requires
          that each IC device be electrically tested at high and depressed
          temperatures (usually -60C to 160C) before shipment (e.g. its clock
          speed). This last testing also establishes general features, such as
          whether a gadget is faulty or satisfies the minimum functional
          performance requirements. From product development in engineering labs
          to final assembly and test on the factory floor, thermal forcing
          system products are employed in the semiconductor manufacturing
          process. Temperature forcing system products are tabletop direct
          contact systems used to evaluate the temperature of integrated
          circuits and other Devices Under Test (DUT), such as high-wattage
          emitting devices. We develop, manufacture, and distribute
          state-of-the-art thermal forcing system solutions to the global
          semiconductor industry for temperature testing of devices in benchtop,
          ATE, and SLT environments. To replicate extreme temperature conditions
          in the lab and later in the test house facility, temperature forcing
          systems are well integrated with automatic test equipment (ATE), SLT,
          and Handlers. CENVS’ temperature forcing system of the highest
          level, is created and developed for thermal testing requiring extreme
          temperatures and quick, accurate results. In its conventional
          configuration, it is a versatile thermal forcing air conditioning
          machine that may be customized to meet specific needs. This adaptable
          and reliable thermal air conditioner is ideal for heating electronic
          components and printed circuits, climate simulations, electronic
          characterizations, and targeted freezing. CENVS provides a
          comprehensive range of precision and thermal control solutions for
          high temperature forcing over a wide range of packages and interfaces.
