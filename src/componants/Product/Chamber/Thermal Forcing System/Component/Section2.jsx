                    <p className='tfs_s2_para'>A temperature forcing system or thermal forcing system is used to test items that undergo rapid temperature fluctuations and temperature cycling. By creating a precise thermal environment that can alter within seconds, the device can determine a product's tolerance to heat and cold. A temperature-forced system is required to perform high and low-temperature cycle tests to verify reliability to ensure that the equipment can normally achieve robust flash memory read and write operations under extreme temperatures (such as oil and gas exploration, heavy industry, and aviation).</p>
