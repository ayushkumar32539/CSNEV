        desc: "A temperature forcing system or thermal forcing system is used to test items that undergo rapid temperature fluctuations and temperature cycling. By creating a precise thermal environment that can alter within seconds, the device can determine a product's tolerance to heat and cold. A temperature-forced system is required to perform high and low-temperature cycle tests to verify reliability to ensure that the equipment can normally achieve robust flash memory read and write operations under extreme temperatures (such as oil and gas exploration, heavy industry, and aviation).

        descpost: "From product creation in product engineering labs to final assembly and test on the production floor, temperature forcing system products are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Engineers test that the sensor or IC is functioning under various environmental circumstances, such as severe temperatures, as part of the qualification and characterization process. Burn-in, electrical, hot and cold testing at certain temperatures and other environmental test simulations are all part of the engineering and production stages to satisfy standards in industries like automotive and aerospace. This is due to the fact that once installed in real-world applications, semiconductor devices are frequently exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Envisys is a global pioneer and innovator in the development, production, and distribution of cutting-edge thermal forcing system solutions, which are largely utilized by semiconductor manufacturers to test their IC devices at high temperatures. The temperature forcing system uses modern and patented technology to provide quick, accurate, stable, and cost-effective solutions. Engineers check the sensor or IC is operational in various environmental circumstances, such as severe temperature, as part of the qualification and characterization process to meet the automotive, airspace, or other industries' criteria. Envisys is revolutionizing temperature testing and control with its industry-standard temperature control units, allowing semiconductor manufacturers to increase their profitability and reliability by improving the efficiency and accuracy of their IC test processes. To appropriately define the device performance, traditional integrated circuit (IC) production requires that each IC device be electrically tested at high and depressed temperatures (usually -60C to 160C) before shipment (e.g. its clock speed). This last testing also establishes general features, such as whether a gadget is faulty or satisfies the minimum functional performance requirements. From product development in engineering labs to final assembly and test on the factory floor, thermal forcing system products are employed in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Temperature forcing system products are tabletop direct contact systems used to evaluate the temperature of integrated circuits and other Devices Under Test (DUT), such as high-wattage emitting devices. We develop, manufacture, and distribute state-of-the-art thermal forcing system solutions to the global semiconductor industry for temperature testing of devices in benchtop, ATE, and SLT environments. To replicate extreme temperature conditions in the lab and later in the test house facility, temperature forcing systems are well integrated with automatic test equipment (ATE), SLT, and Handlers. Envisys’ temperature forcing system of the highest level, is created and developed for thermal testing requiring extreme temperatures and quick, accurate results. In its conventional configuration, it is a versatile thermal forcing air conditioning machine that may be customized to meet specific needs. This adaptable and reliable thermal air conditioner is ideal for heating electronic components and printed circuits, climate simulations, electronic characterizations, and targeted freezing. Envisys provides a comprehensive range of precision and thermal control solutions for high temperature forcing over a wide range of packages and interfaces. ",
