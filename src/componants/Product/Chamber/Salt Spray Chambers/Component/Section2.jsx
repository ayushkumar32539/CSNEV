                Salt Spray Fog Test Corrosion Chambers
              </h2>
              <p>
                A salt spray chamber is a lab simulation of a corrosive saline
                environment. The salt spray test chamber is designed to test the
                performance of items on their surfaces after corrosive
                protection treatments such as painting, coating, galvanizing,
                anodizing, and lubrication. Creative Environmental Solutions
                salt spray corrosion chamber is one of the world most
                sophisticated and versatile salt spray test systems, with
                unrivaled design, ergonomics, and quality.

                Salt spray test chamber products also referred to as as salt fog
                test chambers, are used to assess the resistance to corrosion of
                metal parts, surface coatings, zinc-plated nuts and bolts, and
                paint. Coated samples are exposed to an artificial corrosion
                environment in these salt spray corrosion chambers to check if
                the coating surface is suitable for use as a protective finish
                on final products. Samples are tested inside a salt fog chamber
                for a predetermined amount of time; the higher the corrosion
                resistivity, the longer the test time in the salt fog chamber.

                A cyclic corrosion chamber, also known as a salt fog test
                chamber, is performed in a closed cyclic corrosion test chamber
                that may be altered to simulate a number of corrosive
                environments. During testing, samples are exposed to a specific
                salt concentration for a set duration of time, as established by
                the specification, product type, or industry norms. At CENVS,
                our salt spray corrosion chamber experts are highly qualified
                across several disciplines and our salt fog chamber can be used
                for a variety of products and applications.

                During operation, CENVS salt spray corrosion chamber maintains
                two extremely exact temperatures, which is critical for
                maintaining consistent salt spray concentration and test item
                cover. The working volume is defined as one-tenth of the measure
                of each axis toward the center of the test chamber. The volume
                within the cyclic corrosion chamber exposed to high precision
                temperature uniformity is defined by these minimal measures,
                which are size-dependent.
              </p>
              <p>
                The temperature gradient and the temperature variance in space
                are the two averages that makeup temperature uniform. The
                average difference between the operating temperature in the
                middle of the cyclic corrosion test chamber and numerous
                different arbitrary places around the salt fog chamber is known
                as temperature variation in space. The temperature gradient is
                the average difference in operating temperatures between the
                discretionary points of the salt mist chamber. CENVS guarantees
                that your salt spray corrosion chamber devices will be evaluated
                under consistent, repeatable, and consistent environmental
                conditions.
