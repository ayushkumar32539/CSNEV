                With over 40 years of expertise in the field, CENVS has a
                thorough understanding of environmental testing. It is because
                of this heritage that we have been able to lead the way in the
                design, manufacture, and supply of a wide range of UTM interface
                environmental test chambers. Irrespective of the level of
                testing complexity needed, we assist our clients with our robust
                testing solutions, unrivalled level of flexibility, and
                exceptional client support.

                In a modern, cutting-edge laboratory, tensile and compression
                testing devices, often known as UTMs (Universal Testing
                Machines), are critical in generating reliable data. CENVS, a
                premier manufacturer and supplier of UTM interface environmental
                test chambers in India as well as overseas in countries like the
                USA, UK, and Russia, offers a wide range of chamber solutions to
                our customers. All solutions are custom-built to match the
                user's exact needs, ensuring consistent and accurate data
                collecting and testing.

                An environmental chamber can be purchased with a universal
                testing machine (UTM), or an UTM interface environmental chamber
                can be added to the testing system later if temperature testing
                becomes necessary after the UTM is acquired. Integrating CENVS
                environmental chamber to a universal testing machine (UTM)
                allows for high- or low-temperature testing. Environmental
                chambers come with their own temperature controller, and the
                temperature settings and observations are controlled by the
                UTM's controller or software, depending on the system's
                compatibility. Moreover, our UTM interface environmental test
                chamber makes and models have different specifications, and the
                two classNamees of testing machines, d servo-hydraulic testing
                frames and electromechanical, come with different mechanical
                designs.

                Our high and low-temperature UTM environmental system allows
                materials and equipment to be tested in a range of real-world
                scenarios. The UTM interface environmental test chamber can
                perform a wide range of tests at low and high temperatures. In a
                modern, cutting-edge laboratory, tensile and compression testing
                devices, are critical in generating reliable data. Our UTM
                environmental test chamber is ideal for tension, compression,
                bending, peel and tear tests in a variety of fields, including
                metal wire, plastic, nylon wire, rubber, textile and apparel,
                packaging, and so on. CENVS currently offers a wide range of
                chamber solutions to our customers. For particular industries,
                such as steel manufacturing, glass manufacturing, ceramics, and
                aerospace, CENVS material testing aims to simulate the
                real-world application in order for the results to be valid. As
                a result, testing may demand high-temperature or low-temperature
                settings. All solutions are custom-built to match the user's
                exact needs, ensuring consistent and accurate data collection
                and testing.
