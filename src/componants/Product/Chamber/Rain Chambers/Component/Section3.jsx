            Because of their great quality and affordable price, our rain spray
            test chamber devices are in high demand. Our industrial rain spray
            test chamber has been built to meet international quality and safety
            standards and is compliant with the global standards, ensuring the
            smooth running of the simulation experiment as well as accurate and
            reliable test findings. Furthermore, we ensure that these products
            are delivered on time to our clients, and as a result, we have
            amassed a sizable client base in the industry. Our standardized
            walk-in industrial rain spray test chamber can be configured for the
            rain/spray tests you need, eliminating the speculation in purchasing
            a chamber. Our modular design allows you to add on additional
            features, depending on the number and type of tests required, and is
            built to the requirement from component level testing, and room
            level testing to field testing of large-sized products. Furthermore,
            we are a market leader in the manufacture and delivery of
            high-quality walk-in rain spray test chamber products. CENVS is
            also a leading exporter of industrial rain test chambers to
            countries globally. Our industrial rain spray test chamber products
            are made under the supervision of experienced specialists who
            completely adhere to internationally established rules and
            standards. We also offer these items in a customizable range to meet

            as soon as possible. To assure the product's quality and
            dependability, it must be tested under numerous scenarios. As a
            result, we provide both standard and custom-designed rain spray test
            chamber products to satisfy the needs of our clients. You can use
            the industrial rain spray test chamber to test your products in
            rainy situations. A self-contained water recirculation system in the
            rain spray test chamber eliminates the cost and difficulty of piping
            in a facility's water supply. Water is injected into the test
            container by nozzles that are precisely sized. Water spray is
            supplied by flow meters with adjustment valves at predetermined flow
            rates. In the industrial rain spray test chamber, a rotating test
            platform can be used to provide uniform moisture dispersion across
            the surface of the products being tested. CENVS offers a common
            chamber capable of published and OEM proprietary test techniques,
            making rain and spray testing easier. The standardized rain spray
            test chamber design can be customised for the rain/spray tests you
            require, removing the need for guesswork when purchasing a chamber.
            The system is based on the IP and SAE standards for electronics,
            enclosures, and automotive components. To modify the water spray
            volume/pressure, our system employs numerous control solenoids. If
            necessary, a holding tank heats the water to the desired
            temperature. The water is delivered in the right pressure range
            thanks to a pump. The spray is turned on by a programmable
            controller, which controls the test mode and parameters.
