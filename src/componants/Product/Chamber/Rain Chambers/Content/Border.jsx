        desc: "A test chamber such as the industrial rain spray test chamber is a managed and controlled environment where equipment, products, and chemicals are put to the test to see how long they can last, how stable they are, and how practical they are. They are a controlled environment that simulates the effects of environmental conditions that a product may encounter while in use. Temperature extremes, moist or humid settings, and significant altitude changes are all created in test chambers that have been programmed. Aside from environmental factors, test chambers can be constructed and calibrated to use physical forces like inertia, vibration, and destructive impact to push a product's boundaries. During their service life, products are exposed to a variety of atmospheric agents as well as fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Rain accelerates the degradation process. Lighting, satellite dishes, and autos are all tested in the rain spray test chamber because they are exposed to the outdoors on a regular basis. These products must work dependably in a variety of rain circumstances. Climate and climatic test chambers are a subset of the environmental test chambers that include the rain spray test chamber. Its purpose is to test a product's waterproofing capabilities by imitating a soggy, rainy environment. Electronics, solar rights, underground lights, car lights, fountain lights, automobile parts, garden lights, tunnel lights, and other products all make use of the Rain Spray Test Chamber. Being one of the foremost manufacturers and suppliers of industrial rain spray test chamber products in India, Envisys has built up a wealth of testing experience over the years and, because of their versatility, can construct customized rain spray test chamber products to fulfill every testing requirement as well as special customer requirements. We offer the engineering design capabilities and knowledge to customize industrial rain test chamber products to specific configurations or performance requirements. ",

We also offer these items in a customizable range to meet the needs of clients. Our experts make certain that these products get to the client's premises on time and in good condition. We realize the pressure clients are under to get new products to market as soon as possible. To assure the product's quality and dependability, it must be tested under numerous scenarios. As a result, we provide both standard and custom-designed rain spray test chamber products to satisfy the needs of our clients. You can use the industrial rain spray test chamber to test your products in rainy situations. A self-contained water recirculation system in the rain spray test chamber eliminates the cost and difficulty of piping in a facility's water supply. Water is injected into the test container by nozzles that are precisely sized. Water spray is supplied by flow meters with adjustment valves at predetermined flow rates. In the industrial rain spray test chamber, a rotating test platform can be used to provide uniform moisture dispersion across the surface of the products being tested. Envisys offers a common chamber capable of published and OEM proprietary test techniques, making rain and spray testing easier. The standardized rain spray test chamber design can be customised for the rain/spray tests you require, removing the need for guesswork when purchasing a chamber. The system is based on the IP and SAE standards for electronics, enclosures, and automotive components. To modify the water spray volume/pressure, our system employs numerous control solenoids. If necessary, a holding tank heats the water to the desired temperature. The water is delivered in the right pressure range thanks to a pump. The spray is turned on by a programmable controller, which controls the test mode and parameters. ",
