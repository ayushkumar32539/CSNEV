        desc: "Our offered sub-zero chambers are thoroughly tested by our skilled quality specialists to ensure their reliable operation. Our deep freezer or razor blade treatment chamber for razor blades is designed for the sub-zero freezing of razor blades fresh from the furnace. It uses a sub-zero procedure to cool the heated strip using the conduction principle of heat transmission. A deep freezer is designed to satisfy the changing application needs of simulation of deep temperatures up to -80°C for sub-zero process applications of razor blades coming out of the freezer. Our razor blade treatment chamber includes a cascade water-cooled refrigeration system with a high-efficiency BPHE for the water-cooled condenser and the cascade heat exchanger. For conduction cool passing, an evaporator heat exchanger is created with two layers of a solid aluminum block over a blade passing brass plate. To cool the heated strip for the sub-zero procedure, the deep freezer uses conduction heat transfer. The Sub-zero treatment chamber for Razor Blades is designed for the sub-zero treatment of razor blades coming out of the furnace. It works on the conduction principle of the heat transfer method to cool the heated strip by a sub-zero process.
