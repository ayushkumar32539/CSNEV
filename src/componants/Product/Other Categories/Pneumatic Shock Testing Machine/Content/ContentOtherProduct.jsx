        Product_Sub_Para: "The machine is fabricated with Mild steel of a very robust design to provide necessary mechanical strength and rigidness. The machine produces the shock pulses using compressed air to force the platform to impact on the elastomer pads (Half-Sine Programmer Pads)which are placed between the platform and anvil of the impact area to produce half-sine pulses, Lead pellets are placed to generate sawtooth pulses and pneumatic cylinders are used to generate square pulses. The drop height and the air pressure are responsible to generate the desired acceleration. Shock Test Machine is a versatile test equipment to carry out shock tests in accordance with various National & International standards e.g. IS, MIL, EN, ISO, IEC, DEF & ASTM Standards.",
        Product_Sub_Para2: "The lifting of the platform is done by pneumatic cylinders, the drop height is determined by the desired acceleration level. In a shock test due to the rebounce action secondary shocks may occur, which are totally unacceptable by most of the test standards. Fail safe brakes are used as a rebounce brake and as a quick release device to avoid secondary and tertiary shocks. The shock test machine is isolated from the ground by heavy duty shockers and shock absorbers. The Shock test machine is supported by a PC based intelligent Instrumentation system to control, monitor and analyse acquired shock test waveforms. The system has 4 channels to monitor the shock pulses generated which are expandable upto 16 channels.",
