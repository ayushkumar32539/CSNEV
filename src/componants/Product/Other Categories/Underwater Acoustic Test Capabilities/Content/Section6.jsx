    para : 'CENVS SignalSound systems are able to generate the narrowband lines and broadband noise that is associated with the acoustic signatures of ships and submarines. SignalSound products can also generate sonar pulses as an echo repeater to interact with active sonar. This signal processing solution is based on CENVS Abacus and Quattro hardware and is highly accurate both in component generation and measurement. External signals can be imported for replay or target signals can be generated with multiple lines, broadband noise, and modulation effects. The ability to both measure and record signals allows full recording of trials signals for post-test analysis and future comparison.',
