The machine is intended to reproduce the effects of repetitive bumps 60 to 180 bumps per minute likely to be experienced by components and equipment during transportation or when installed in various classes of vehicles. The machine is mounted on air springs and heavy duty shockers are also used to isolate it from the ground.",

The object mounting hole pattern of the platform is 100 X 100mmmatrix or as desired by the customer. An optional T-slot for mounting of test objects is also provided.",
        Product_Sub_Para2: "The mounting platform is lifted vertically through a Cam arrangement and is made to drop freely / forcefully on the Elastomer pad (Half-Sine Programmer Pad) placed on the anvil which provides the required acceleration level. The desired impact acceleration can be obtained by adjusting the drop height of the mounting platform. Elastomer pads are used to produce half-sine pulses, duration of pulse can be adjusted by changing the hardness and thickness of the rubber pads.",
