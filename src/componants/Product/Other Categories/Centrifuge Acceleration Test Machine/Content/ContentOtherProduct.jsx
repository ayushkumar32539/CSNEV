        Pera: "DAS’s Centrifuge Machine is used to analyze the mechanical behavior/fitment and integrity of parts and assemblies subjected to linear acceleration. It is used in the Avionics, Military hardware testing, Satellite components testing, Telecom &  Automobiles Industries,  R&D laboratories for Qualification testing, Product development & their Reliability, Stress screening etc as per relevant ISO, IEC, JSS 55555, MIL and other international Standards.",
        Pera2: "The Centrifuge machine for acceleration testing has a robust structure that consists of an outer enclosure for safety point of view to withstand vibration & Rotational Forces produced by centrifugal force acting on the test object. It consists of a rotating platform with provision to mount and accommodate on either side, a wide variety of payloads, in various sizes at a required radial distance from centre to achieve the desired acceleration. The platform is driven by PMBL servo motor to get highest level of rpm accuracy. The speed of platform is varied by the PWM based IGBT Servo Drive with instrumentation system having built-in digital closed loop control and associated Speed Control panel.",
        Pera3: "DAS Linear Acceleration Machines are available from 0.5g’ to 80000 ’g’. Facility of visual monitoring of Unit under Test mounted on platform is through CCTV. Camera, Electrical, Electronic, Data transfer, RF, Pneumatic, Hydraulic connections are available quality Slip rings for actual working conditions during rotation and test environment.",
        Pera4: "Our CENTRIFUGE MACHINE FOR ACCELERATION testing consists of a rotating platform which has Metric threaded holes to mount the object/specimen at a required radial distance from center to achieve the desired acceleration on a particular RPM of platform. The desired acceleration is dependent on radial distance and speed of rotating platform from a dedicated formula. it is stated that required acceleration is to be achieved by proper selection of radial distance and rotating speed of an object.",
        Pera5: "The Machine is supported by PC Based instrumentation system to control & monitor the test parameters. The system is more versatile with a suitably designed LABVIEW based GUI program to control, monitor various parameters with data logging and data Analysis features for setting RPM/speed, Acceleration “g”, Nominal Radius, Test time, unit ID etc. as per the test application. Requirements. All safety interlocks e.g. Imbalance, Door open etc. are configured & monitored via data transfer to external. PC with associating software. The software supports break points in a single test profile."
