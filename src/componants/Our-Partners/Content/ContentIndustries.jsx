Inertial shakers are sometimes used to induce lower frequency energy in airframes and other structures. Inertial shakers can be mounted and fully supported in hard-to-reach locations on the structure. Modal shakers are most often used for structural excitation. These vibration exciters are available in a large range of sizes, from very portable models with relatively high force to models that are capable of several hundred pounds of force. Many models of modal shakers feature rotary linear bearings to completely isolate the shaker dynamics from the structure.",
